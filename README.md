# Joke News Inc

This full-stack, RESTful app is designed for a news editor. It contains a database of journalists and news articles. The app enables the editor to:
* view a list of all articles in the database
* view full details of each article
* edit an article
* add a new article
* view a list of all journalists in the database
* view full details of each journalist
* edit a journalist’s details
* add a new journalist

## Software used:
* Java back-end using Spring framework
* Database: SQL with postgreSQL
* JavaScript front-end using React framework
* Insomnia used for testing the RESTful routes

## To run the app:
Once you have git pulled:
* In the command line, type `createdb newsservice`
* Open the Server folder using IntelliJ. Run the Server Application file.
* Open the client folder:
  * `npm install`

## Features we’re proud of:
This was the first full stack application using a Java (Spring) back-end and a JavaScript (React) front-end, and we learned how to get the back-end and front-end to communicate with each other. The user can input data in the front-end, and this is then stored in the database in the back-end.
